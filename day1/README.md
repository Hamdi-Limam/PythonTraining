## Learn Python with Let Us DevOps

### Day 1: Basic constructs like data structure and loops[for and while]

If you are starting to learn any programming language, you generally start with hello world. 
This is a simple task of printing the hello world in that particular language. In Python its just 1 line


```buildoutcfg
print('Hello World")
```

* Then you move to other important constructs of the programming language. These constructs or basics can be different data types, how to write a function, how to loop over elements etc. 

* So your 1st day is dedicated to learning these constructs. I am assuming all of you are working in linux so need to install Python. It will be pre installed. If you are using Windows, its your headache to install python[don't be angry I said this because I recommend every DevOps person to use linux in their day to day use.]

### Task 1: Learn how you can create a string, an integer and an array. 
* This video should help you in learning about data types: [Data Types in Python: LetUsDevs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uU2hEWsfYL8&list=PLhqPDa2HoaAZN9pG0cUugTmgAddRtF3zK&index=2&ab_channel=LetUsDevOps)

* It is a lengthy video watch it at 1.5x speed. 

* **Write a program** to initialize string, int variable and use them. 

### Task 2: Learn how you can loop through a list of elements. 

* Try to create an array of element and loop over it. 
* Practice: Try to generate table to 2,3,4 and 5

* You can read about loops here: [Loops in Python: LetUsDevOps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQIttkwqmWc&list=PLhqPDa2HoaAZN9pG0cUugTmgAddRtF3zK&index=4&ab_channel=LetUsDevOps)
#### There are two ways to loop through an array. Look at the example below

```buildoutcfg
list = [1,2,3,4]
for i in list: 
    print(i)
```

and 
```buildoutcfg
list = [1,2,3,4]
i = 0
for i in range(len(list)):
    print(list[i])
```
* Try to find out what is the difference between two and when to use which one. 

* You can do the same with while loop. 


### Task 3: WAP to generate odd and even numbers with for and while loops. 
* Two programs to generate even and then odd. 
* You can also try solving **fizzbuzz** problem as an extended goal. 

#### If you are not able to any of the program you can simply type the problem and you will find the code on google.
#### Learning how to Google is a very important tasks. Let's try to sharpen that skill with these exercises. 

### Online Problems that you can try solving: 
1. [Python Loops](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-loops/problem)
2. [Python Lists](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-lists/problem)
3. [Python Strings](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/python-string-split-and-join/problem)



Try to practice them and put it on Github. With this you will learn a lot of new things that are used in DevOps. Push your code to different branches and raise MR and then merge them. 

### This is it for Day 1. All the best!
