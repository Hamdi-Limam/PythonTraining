## HTTP vs HTTPS

### What Is HTTP?
**HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol**. At it’s most basic, it allows for the communication between different systems. It’s most commonly used **to transfer data from a web server to a browser** in order to allow users to view web pages. It’s the protocol that was used for basically all early websites.

### What Is HTTPS?
**HTTPS stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure**. The problem with the regular HTTP protocol is that the information that flows from server to browser is not encrypted, which means it can be easily stolen. HTTPS protocols remedy this by using an **SSL (secure sockets layer) certificate**, which helps ***create a secure encrypted connection between the server and the browser***, thereby protecting potentially sensitive information from being stolen as it is transferred between the server and the browser.

### What is the main difference between HTTP and HTTPS?

The most important difference between the two protocols is the ***SSL certificate***. In fact, HTTPS is basically an HTTP protocol with additional security. However, this additional security can be extremely important, especially for websites that take sensitive data from its users, such as credit card information and passwords.

However, the security advantage isn’t the only benefit of using HTTPS. In fact, switching over to HTTPS can end up **boosting your SEO (Search engine optimization)** efforts as well.

### How do HTTPS works?
The SSL certificate encrypts the information that users supply to the site, which basically **translates the data into a code**. Even if someone manages to steal the data being communicated between the sender and the recipient, they would not be able **to understand it due to this encryption**.

But in addition to adding that extra layer of security, HTTPS is also secured via [TLS (Transport Layer Security)protocol](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/ssl-vs-tls-difference/). TLS helps provide **data integrity**, which helps prevent the transfer of data from being modified or corrupted, and **authentication**, which proves to your users that they are communicating with the intended website.

### Conclusion
So, to recap, the difference between HTTP vs HTTPS is simply the presence of an **SSL certificate**. HTTP doesn’t have SSL and HTTPS has SSL, which encrypts your information so your connections are secured. HTTPS also has **TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol** that HTTP lacks. HTTPS is **more secure** than HTTP.
