## Explanation of the first program

Like you see, we got x is an empty list:
```
x = []
```

Then, we got an if-else condition statement, if the condition is True, we will print x and True. Else, we will print x and False.

In python, empty sequence, mapping and False, Zero of any numeric type and None are considered as False Values:
* empty list: [] -> False
* empty dict: {} -> False
* empty set: () -> False
* empty string '' -> False
* None -> False 
* x = 0 -> False

So, the condition `x:` is False, it will execute the else part and it will print `[] False`
